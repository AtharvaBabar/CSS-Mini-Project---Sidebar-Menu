# CSS-Mini-Project---Sidebar-Menu
This project is a CSS-based sliding sidebar menu built using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons. It features a smooth animation that reveals a semi-transparent sidebar over a full-screen background image. The menu includes navigation links, social media icons, and responsive interactions such as hover effects and toggle buttons.
